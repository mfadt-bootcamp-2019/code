## Resources to get started

These are resources to help you get up and running (getting Processing and Github installed).

Here are some tips for downloading Processing:

* After downloading, move to your User Directory
* Open it up to make sure it works
* Keep somewhere you’ll remember
	* e.g. `Documents/Processing` is a good spot

### Github Desktop

Some tips for downloading Github Desktop

* Once you open it you’ll be able to log in (if you already have a Github account) or create an account
	* Pick a good username!
