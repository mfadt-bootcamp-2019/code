# Week 1 - Day 4

* **Comparison and logical operators** 
* Aug 1, 2019
* Status: in progress


## Summary
This module introduces comparison operators (e.g. `<`, `>`,`==`,`!=`) and logical operators (e.g. `&&`, `||`, `!`) through a series of hands-on Processing sketches.


## Operators

**Operators** are symbols that *operate* on values. In Processing syntax, operators are positioned between the values that they operate on (e.g. x **multiplied by** 5). *Operate on* can mean many things.

**Summary of Processing Operators** [(see Processing reference page)][1]

| Operator type  | Description | Symbols | Example use |
| -------------- | ----------- | :------:| ------- |
| Multiplicative | Multiply, divide, or find remainder of two values | `*`, `/`, `%` | `x * 5` <br> *x multiplied by five* |
| Additive       | Add or find the difference between two values | `+`, `-` | `x + 5` <br> *x plus five* |
| Relational     | Test whether one value is less than or greater than another | `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | `x > 5` <br> *x is greater than 5 |
| Equality       | Test whether two values are either equal or not | `==`, `!=` | `x == 5` <br> *x is equal to 5* |
| Logical AND    | Combine multiple relational or equality tests with AND | `&&` | `x == 5 && y > 7` <br> *x is equal to five AND y is greater than seven* |
| Logical OR     | Combine multiple relational or equality tests with OR | `\|\|` | `x == 5 \|\| y > 7` <br> *Either x is equal to five OR y is greater than seven* |
| Assignment     | Assign value to variable | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` | `x = 5` <br> *Assign x the value of five* |

In this module, we will use *Relational*, *Equality*, *Logical AND*, *Logical OR*, and *Assignment operators*.
