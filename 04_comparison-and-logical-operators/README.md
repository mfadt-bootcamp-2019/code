# Week 1 - Day 4

* **Comparison and logical operators** 
* Aug 1, 2019
* Status: in progress


## Summary
This module introduces comparison operators (e.g. `<`, `>`,`==`,`!=`) and logical operators (e.g. `&&`, `||`, `!`) through a series of hands-on Processing sketches.


## Operators

**Operators** are symbols that act on variables. What does act *act on* mean? ...It can mean many things.

* Some operators stand for actions that are applied between values (e.g. *x **`divided by`** 5*).
* Some test relationships between values (e.g. *x **`does not equal`** 5*).
* Some combine multiple relationship tests (e.g. *x `does not equal` 5 **`AND`** x `does not equal` 7*).
* Some assign values to variables (e.g. *x **`equals`** 5*)

In Processing, operators are applied *between* the values that they act on or describe (note that not *all* languages do this).

[**Summary of Processing Operators**][1]

| Operator type  | Description | Symbols |
| -------------- | ----------- | :------:|
| Multiplicative | *Multiply, divide, or find remainder of two values* | `*`, `/`, `%` |
| Additive       | *Add or find the difference between two values* | `+`, `-` |
| Relational     | *Test whether one value is less than or more than another* | `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` |
| Equality       | *Test whether two values are either equal or not* | `==`, `!=` |
| Logical AND    | *Combine multiple relational or equality tests with AND* | `&&` |
| Logical OR     | *Combine multiple relational or equality tests with OR* | `\|\|` |
| Assignment     | *Assign value to variable* | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` |

In this module, we will use *Relational*, *Equality*, *Logical AND*, *Logical OR*, and *Assignment operators*.
