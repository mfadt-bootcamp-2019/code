# Day 06, Functions

> Let the FUNctions begin (ha ha, get it?)

## Summary
This module discusses functions, variable scope, and more types of user input


## Functions

**Functions** work like methods that we can define ourselves! 
* We can write our own code, store it in a function, and re-use it as many times as we want
* Functions are great for usability and modularity - they help us keep code shorter and simpler
* See the function_intro_example sketch for some messy code that we will use functions to organize


## Variable scope
**Local variables** are defined within functions
**Global variables** are defined at the top of the sketch
* MOST of our variables should remain local - this keeps our code cleaner and more organized, and makes sure that we donâ€™t accidentally mess things up by duplicating variable names
* See the scope_error_example sketch for some code that illustrates why we need to be aware of scope

## User input
In addition to mouseX and mouseY, which we learned last week, there are a bunch of other user inputs we can use!
* When in doubt, check processing.org/reference/
* See keyboard_input sketch for some code that we can spice up using different inputs

## Homework
Keep working on any of these three sketches
* Try adding different types of user input, or changing what happens on user input. 
* Try creating a function that involves user input
* Try making the global variables local - what happens? Does something break, or does it still work?
