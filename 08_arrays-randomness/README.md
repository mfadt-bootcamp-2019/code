# Day 08, Arrays & Randomness

> Arrays and randomness

## Bouncing Balls

* Start with the code for a single [bouncing ball](ball_01)
* Now we're going to make 100 bouncing balls
	* Arrays!
* How can randomness make this more interesting?

## Pattern Generation

* Let's look at some patterns :))))))))
	* [Anni Albers](https://www.google.com/search?q=anni+albers&source=lnms&tbm=isch)
* Pseudocode: how would we create something like this?
	* Pair psuedocode programming (one person draws pattern as dictated by another person)
* Livecoding one pattern together ([this beautiful one](https://nmwa.org/works/untitled-3))
