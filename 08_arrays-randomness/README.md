# Day 08 & 09, Arrays & Randomness

> Arrays and randomness

## Bouncing Balls

![Balls!](img/balls.png)

#### What we'll cover together

* Start with the code for a single [bouncing ball](ball_01)
* Now we're going to make 100 bouncing balls
	* Arrays!
* How can randomness make this more interesting?

#### What you can do on your own

* What else can you randomize in this sketch?
	* Color? Speed? Shape?
* How many balls can you add before the program crashes?
* Add gravity to the balls so they fall over time
* Can you do collision detection? We can't
	* Start by changing the sketch to use [Objects and Classes](https://processing.org/tutorials/objects/)
