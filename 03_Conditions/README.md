# Week 1 - Day 3

* **Variables and Conditionals** 
* July 31, 2019
* Status: in progress


## Summary
This module introduces the Color Variables, Booleans, mousePressed, and Conditionals through a series of small excercises each of which build upon the previous.


## Booleans

**Booleans** are a binary data type that stores either the value True or False.

**Summary of Booleans** [(see Processing reference page)][1]

## Conditionals or "if" statements
A statement that outlines the necessary conditions for specific code to be executed. A variable is a way to store stuff, and know we need to know what do with that stuff and when, that is where an if statment comes in.
**Summary of if statements** [(see Processing reference page)][2]
 
## mousePressed
Similar to Booleans, mousePressed, returns either the value True or False, but only when mouse click input is received.
**Summary of mousePressed** [(see Processing reference page)][3]

## Color
Datatype for storing color values. Can accept RGB, hexadecimal, and grayscale values.
**Summary of Color** [(see Processing reference page)][4]

## Excercise
After stepping through each concept, and exploring them through processing sketches we will bring them together to use mouse input to change the color of our square.
